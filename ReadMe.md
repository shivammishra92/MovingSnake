This code is written in C++ and is a simple implementation of a snake game using the Simplecpp library for graphics. The game initializes a grid where the snake moves and allows the player to control the snake's direction using keyboard input. 
The snake moves through the grid, and the player's goal is typically to collect items or avoid collisions.
